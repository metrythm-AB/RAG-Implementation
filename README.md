Description:-
This project explores the concept of Retrieval-Augmented Generation which combines document retrieval with language model generation. By integrating external information retrieval the system can provide more accurate and contextually relevant answers. The project aims to implement RAG and to understand working related to it.

1.Installation Instructions
To set up the project, ensure you have Python installed then install the required packages using pip:
!pip install pinecone-client
!pip install transformers sentence-transformers
!pip install openai==0.28

Environment Setup:-
Use a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other projects
Ensure you have access to the necessary API keys for Pinecone and OpenAI

2.Usage
a)Basic Text-Based RAG Implementation
Load your documents and encode them using the SentenceTransformer model all-MiniLM-L6-v2
Store the embeddings in Pinecone for efficient retrieval
Query the system to retrieve relevant documents based on a user query
b)Multimodal RAG Implementation
Extend the implementation to handle both text and images using a suitable embedding model (e.g., CLIP)
Store both text and image embeddings in Pinecone and allow querying for both types of data
Example Code Snippet
Hereâ€™s a brief example of how to query the system:
query_embedding = model.encode("What is artificial intelligence?").tolist()
results = index.query(vector=query_embedding, top_k=3, include_values=True)
retrieved_docs = [documents[int(match['id'])] for match in results['matches']]
print("Retrieved Documents:", retrieved_docs)

3.Changelog
